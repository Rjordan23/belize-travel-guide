I wanted to test what I could do with html and css so I went to dribbble.com to find a design to recreate. 
The original idea came from this page https://dribbble.com/shots/3104643-Fire-Ice-Website/attachments/655216
Responsivness is not a consideration for this site as it is mainly to show progression. Although, I may come back and add full responsivness after the other two projects are finished.
