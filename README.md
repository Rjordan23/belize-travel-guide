I wanted to test what I could do with html and css so I went to dribbble.com to find a design to recreate. 
The original idea came from this page https://dribbble.com/shots/3104643-Fire-Ice-Website/attachments/655216
This is only my 3rd website built but the progression has been rapid. After completing the Axiom Bank project I wanted to no only take on a more challenging design but be able to complete it as quickly as possible. Responsivness is not a consideration for this site as it is mainly to show progression and to enhance my speed when working on a project. I may come back and add full responsivness after the other two projects are finished.
At this point I feel I can create any design from a pdf or replicate a website.
Gaining a better grasp of JS then on to  Angular or React are my main goals after this is completed
